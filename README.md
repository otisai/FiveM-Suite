# ðŸŒŸ Otis' FiveM Suite

I've been taking a hiatus from AI development and have been spending time developing MLOs, clothing, and most importantly, scripts for FiveM servers.

This repository serves as a suite for all of my finished scripts, and I plan to keep it updated with most of my work from here on out. With a goal to eventually do some development for a bigger server, this will also serve as an example of my capabilities.

All of the scripts, plugins, and other resources in this repository are **free to use** on any server or game as long as you do not take credit for my code and/or assets.

## Script List

## Contributing

As always, contributions are encouraged and welcomed. If you want a feature implemented and it has not yet been made, feel free to take a crack at it and make a PR when you are finished!

PRs are open, however anything regarding tiny, non-breaking fixes such as grammar, typos, whitespace, etc. will be ignored.
